# A realtime selection form using [socket.io](//socket.io)
Real time project selection for final year projects. Developed using Socket.io, Node.js and Google Auth. This project was a departmental project for project topics selection by students. Entire batches simultaneously selected projects in real-time and based on their ranked choice and FCFS, topics and guides were allocated to the students. This software was used for multiple batches of students and is still being used in the department (Information Science and Engineering, Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering Bengaluru) to this day.
